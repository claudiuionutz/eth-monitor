# eth-monitor
## 1. Purpose
Create an automated job that will restart the box once it determines that eth-miner is stuck.
## 2. Usage
So far there is no .rpm/package available so it needst to be manually installed.

  * Download and copy the eth-monitor.sh to a suitable location, like /opt and grant execution rights to eth-monitor.sh

``` bash
cd /opt
sudo mkdir eth-monitor
sudo chown ethos eth-monitor
cd eth-monitor
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claudiuionutz/eth-monitor/master/eth-monitor.sh
chmod +x eth-monitor.sh
mkdir logs
```

  * Create cron job using crontab to schedule every 10 minutes: 

```bash
crontab -e
```

``` bash
*/10 * * * * /opt/eth-monitor/eth-monitor.sh >> /opt/eth-monitor/logs/eth-monitor.log 2>&1
```
Shouldn't run any more frequent as miners will take a few minutes to start. Maybe a restart condition should always be considered to avoid that. 

  * Optionally you can change log location, ideally on a separate partition

## 3. TODO:

  1. Find suitable log location; /run/shm is being cleaned at restart 
  2. Add looping logic
  3. Consider logrotate
