# eth-monitor
# 1. Purpose
Create an automated job that will restart the box once it determines that eth-miner is stuck.
# 2. Usage
So far there is no .rpm/package available so it needst to be manually installed.
..* Download and copy the eth-monitor.sh to a suitable location, like
..* Grant execution rights to eth-monitor.sh, 
``` bash
chmod +x eth-monitor.sh
```
..* Create crontab to schedule every 10 minutes: 
``` bash
*/10 * * * * /{location-tbd}/eth-monitor/eth-monitor.sh >> /{location-tbd}/eth-monitor.log 2>&1
```
Shouldn't run any more frequent as miners will take a few minutes to start. Maybe a restart condition should always be considered to avoid that. 

# 3. TODO:
..1. Find suitable location (consider logging) 
..2. Add looping logic
..3. Consider logrotate
